_Fork of [AutoChunkLoader](https://github.com/mlebdmcdev/AutoChunkLoader) cause it has some bug, 
and doesn't support observers and hoppers._

A simple plugin that loads chunks around long railways and redstone signals, 
and keep chunks with observers and working hoppers (pipes and timers).

It can be used for transporting resources in chest minecarts through whole world, 
making large redstone circuits, making auto-farms on a long distance.
